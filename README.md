# Cluster

This project aims to reproduce large-scale clusters' structure to a small teaching example using Raspberry Pi (10 of them). To illustratre how the cluster works, we used bruteforce.

## Technologies

* Ansible for config deployement
* SLURM for cluster management
* Ganglia to monitor the Pi

## Project's structure

* "bruteforce" : small cpp application which bruteforces a password with a limited complexity ([a-z])

* cluster : contains all the deployement files for Ansible and the configuration for the nodes

* web inteface : is used to have a graphical feedback and be able to start hacking passwords from there : [gopicluster
